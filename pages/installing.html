  <h1>Installing Silverblue</h1>

  <p>The preferred way to install Silverblue is with the Fedora MediaWriter application.
  See the <a href="https://teamsilverblue.org/download">Download</a> page for details on
  how to create a USB stick to install Silverblue.</p>

  <p><i>NOTE:  The following instructions are written in detail, assuming that you have
  never installed Fedora before.  If you have experience using or installing Fedora, you
  may be able to skip much of these instructions.</i></p>

  <h2>Before You Begin</h2>

  <p>Before you start the installation process, you should answer the following questions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Do you want to retain any existing data on your system?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If yes, you should consider using the <a href="#manual-partition">manual partitioning</a>
            method during the install process.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, if your system has an existing Fedora install on it, you could
            use the <a href="#side-by-side">side-by-side</a> install method.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Do you want to do a fresh install and do not care about retaining any existing
        data on your system?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If yes, you should consider using the <a href="#automatic-partition">automatic partitioning</a>
            method during the install process.  This is the easiest way to get Silverblue
            installed on your system.</li>
        <li>You may still use the <a href="#manual-partition">manual partitioning</a> method
            during the install process, but it will require some additional steps.</li>
     </ul>
  </ul>

  <h2>Starting the Install</h2>

  <p>After you have successfully created your USB stick, you'll need to boot your system
  from the USB stick.  Depending on your system, you might get lucky and it will boot from
  USB automatically.  Otherwise, you'll need to figure out how to access the boot menu of
  your system's BIOS/UEFI and select the USB stick as the boot device.</p>

  <p>You should see a Fedora 28 installation screen that is identical to the Fedora 28
  Workstation installer:</p>

  <img src="/public/install/faw-boot-menu.png" alt="Fedora 28 Installer Menu"/>

  <p>From this menu, you can choose to test the media to ensure that the USB stick was
  created successfully.  Or launch right into the installer if you are feeling confident.
  For the purposes of this guide, we know our USB stick is working properly, so we'll
  start the installer.  You may see some messages fly past your screen that look like
  this:</p>

  <img src="/public/install/faw-boot-output.png" alt="Fedora Installer Services Output" />

  <p>Eventually, the graphical installer should start and you'll be presented with the
  options to select the language you wish to use during the install:</p>

  <img src="/public/install/faw-boot-welcome.png" alt="Fedora Installer Language Selection" />

  <p>After selecting your language, the next screen of the installer allows us to make
  additional selections regarding the installer.  We can configure the keyboard layout,
  installed language support, date and time, networking, and partitioning.  In this guide
  we are only going to focus on the partitioning because of certain restrictions in this
  area when using Silverblue.  However, if you have questions about some of the options
  of this part (or any part) of the installer, you can consult the
  <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/f28/install-guide/install/Installing_Using_Anaconda.html">Fedora Installation Guide</a>.</p>

  <p>On this screen, you should notice that there is a warning on the bottom of the screen
  that says you need to complete the items marked with the warning icon before we can begin
  the actual install.  Additionally, the 'Begin Installation' button is greyed out.  The
  item that needs to be completed is the partitioning and we can start that process by
  selecting the "Installation Destination" item with the warning icon next to it:</p>

  <img src="/public/install/faw-summary-one.png" alt="Fedora Installtion Summary" />

  <p>After choosing the "Installation Destination", you are brought to a screen where
  you have to decide if you want to use automatic partitioning or manual partitioning.
  If you have existing data on your disk and want to preserve it, you'll want to
  <a href="#manual-partition">manually partition</a> your disk(s).  However, if you
  are comfortable with losing any and all existing data on your disk(s), you can choose
  <a href="#automatic-partition">automatic partitioning</a>:<p>

  <img src="/public/install/faw-storage-start.png" alt="Fedora Installation Destination" />

  <h2 id="automatic-partition">Automatic Partitioning</h2>

  <p>If you choose automatic partitioning, your job is almost done.  Select the disk you
  want to install onto (in this guide we have only a single disk).  Check the radio button
  that says 'Automatic' and click the big blue button at the top that says 'Done'.</p>

  <p>If your disk already has partitions on it, you'll be presented with a dialog to
  'reclaim' space.  This means you are going choose which partitions can be deleted, so
  that the disk can be re-partitioned from scratch.</p>

  <img src="/public/install/faw-storage-reclaim.png" alt="Reclaim Disks Dialog" />

  <p>In this guide, we are going to delete all the existing partitions so that we can
  use the entirety of the disk for the install.  This is easily done with the aptly
  named 'Delete All' button.</p>

  <img src="/public/install/faw-storage-reclaim-two.png" alt="Delete All Partitions" />

  <p>And then confirm that you are going to delete all the partitions by clicking the
  'Reclaim space' button:</p>

  <img src="/public/install/faw-storage-reclaim-delete-all.png" alt="Confirming Delete All Partitions" />

  <p>With your partitioning choice complete, the installer brings you back to the
  installation summary screen and the big blue 'Begin Installation' button is beckoning
  you to click it.  Once you click the button, your disk(s) will be altered and all data
  on the disk(s) will be lost.</p>

  <img src="/public/install/faw-summary-two.png" alt="Ready to Begin Installation" />

  <p>Once you have started the install process, you can move on to the next phase
  where you will <a href="#user-config">configure users</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="manual-partition">Manual Partitioning</h2>

  <p>Coming Soon...</p>

  <h2 id="side-by-side">Installing Side-by-Side on an Existing System</h2>

  <p>There will be detailed instructions on how to install Silverblue along side an
  existing Fedora installation in the near future.  If you are would like to explore
  this method now, you can use <a href="https://pagure.io/workstation-ostree-config/blob/master/f/README-install-inside.md">these instructions</a>
  from the <code>workstation-ostree-config</code> repo.</p>

  <h2 id="user-config">User Configuration</h2>

  <p>As the installer churns away, you are presented with a screen where you can configure
  the root password and create one or more regular users:</p>

  <img src="/public/install/faw-progress-one.png" alt="Configuring Users" />

  <p>Firstly, let's configure a root password.  Be sure to choose a safe and strong
  password that contains a mix of upper and lower case characters, numbers, and
  symbols.  The installer has a nice indicator during this root password process
  that estimates the strength of your password; aim for creating a password that is
  "Strong":</p>

  <img src="/public/install/faw-root-pw-two.png" alt="Choosing a Strong Root Password" />

  <p>Then we can create a normal, unprivileged user which we will use as our day
  to day login.  The same suggestions about creating a password for this user applies.
  Additionally, we can choose to make the user an administrator on the system, which
  grants the username the ability to use the <code>sudo</code> command to elevate their
  privileges:</p>

  <img src="/public/install/faw-user-two.png" alt="Creating an Unprivileged User" />

  <p>Once we have the root password configured and an unprivileged user configured, we
  just sit back and wait for the installer to complete:</p>

  <img src="/public/install/faw-progress-two.png" alt="Waiting for the Installer to Complete" />

  <p>Eventually, the installer will finish and you will be presented with a big, blue
  button that says 'Reboot'.  This will (obviously) reboot your system and you'll be
  able to login to your Silverblue installation for the first time!</p>
